# CommunityKit
CommunityKit is a server and client meant to host a dungeon crawl game and features for a community playing that game, such as chat and mail. After the dungeon crawl is complete, stretch goals are to add other common games such as board/card games.

This is the public repository for documentation and issue tracking for CommunityKit.

# Random Trivia
I have been working on CommunityKit for about four months.
* The first push was between April 17 and July 24 2018.
* The current push began November 5, 2018.

As of December 9, 2018, CommunityKit is 79,065 lines of code. Close to 90% of planned features have been implemented. I expect it will need a rigorous bug testing period when it is feature complete.

The server runs on .NET Core 2.0.

The client uses the XNA platform, and is portable to MonoGame/FNA for cross-platform purposes.
