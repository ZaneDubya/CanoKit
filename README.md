# Welcome to CommunityKit
My name is Zane, and I'm working on a modern engine for games in the style of [The Shadow of Yserbius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_of_Yserbius). Thanks for checking it out!

Released in 1993, Yserbius was one of the first online graphical RPGs. Up to 60 people at a time could meet up, create adventuring parties, and delve deep into monster-filled dunegons. When you were done adventuring, you could venture off with your friends to play other games on the Imagination Network, which modestly described itself as "the friendlest place in cyberspace".

I have very fond memories of Yserbius and the Imagination Network. CommunityKit is my attempt to recreate that kind of experience: the ability to create a persona, to play fun games with other people, and to be a part of a community that is welcoming, helpful, and supportive. 

The proof-of-concept goal of CommunityKit will be a modern reimplementation of The Shadow of Yserbius. After the dungeon crawl is complete, my stretch goals are to add community features such as in-game mail, and add other common games such as board/card games. Following the completion of the stretch goals, I plan to use the dungeon crawn engine to build a brand new scenario, with new assets and mechanics.

This is the public repository for documentation and issue tracking for CommunityKit.

* Check out [progress on the current milestone here](https://github.com/ZaneDubya/CommunityKitPublic/milestone/5).

## Road Map (Estimated)
* Dungeon Crawl Feature Complete - Complete January 1, 2019.
* Tavern, Assets, and bug fixes - Expected January 2019.
* Polish and closed testing - Febuary 2019.
* Public Release - Expected March 2019.
* Hypercare and stabilization after launch - expected to end May 2019.

## Development History
* I have been working on CommunityKit for about five months.
* The first push was between April 17 and July 24, 2018.
* The current push began November 5, 2018 and is ongoing.
* My best estimate is that it will be ready for release in early 2019.
* I also expect it will need a rigorous bug testing period after release.

CommunityKit is written in C#.

  * The Server is 40,119 lines of code.
  * The Client is 35,609 lines of code.
  * The Shared Codebase is 5,822 lines of code.
* The server runs on .NET Core 2.0.
* The client runs on the XNA platform, portable to MonoGame/FNA for cross-platform releases.
