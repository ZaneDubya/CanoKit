# Welcome to CommunityKit

CommunityKit is the engine that runs MedievaLands, my remake of Shadow of Yserbius. It has native clients for Windows and Mac OS, with a Linux server running on the .NET Core framework. Learn more at [www.MedievaLands.com](https://www.MedievaLands.com).

This is the public repository for documentation and issue tracking for CommunityKit.

You may also want to visit [ZaneDubya/YserbiusData](https://github.com/ZaneDubya/YserbiusData), which contains decompiled Yserbius resource files and data from the executable files.
