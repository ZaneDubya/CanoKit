# Welcome to CommunityKit
My name is Zane, and I'm working on a modern engine for games in the style of [The Shadow of Yserbius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_of_Yserbius). Thanks for checking it out!

Released in 1993, Yserbius was one of the first online RPGs. Up to 60 people at a time could meet up, create adventuring parties, and delve deep into monster-filled dunegons. Then, after you were done adventuring, you could venture off with your friends to play other games on the Imagination Network, which modestly billed itself as "the friendlest place in cyberspace".

I have very fond memories of Yserbius and the Imagination Network. CommunityKit is my attempt to recreate that kind of experience. As a proof of concept, I'm going to first focus on creating a modern reimplementation of Yserbius. After the dungeon crawl is complete, my stretch goals are to add community features such as in-game mail, and add other common games such as board/card games.

# Development
I have been working on CommunityKit for about four months.
* The first push was between April 17 and July 24, 2018.
* The current push began November 5, 2018 and is ongoing.
* My best estimate is that it will be feature complete in early 2019.
* I also expect it will need a rigorous bug testing period after release.

CommunityKit is written in C#.
* As of December 9, 2018, CommunityKit is 79,065 lines of code. 
* The server runs on .NET Core 2.0.
* The client runs on the XNA platform, and is portable to MonoGame/FNA for cross-platform releases.
