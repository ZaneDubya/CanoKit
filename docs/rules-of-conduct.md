Our Responsibilities:

Those who manage and represent CommunityKit are responsible for taking appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Enforcement:

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, or violations of any of the Rules of Conduct, may be reported by clicking the "Complain" button within the CommunityKit software. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated. If a response is deemed necessary, a response will be made that is appropriate to the circumstances. When those who manage or represent CommunityKit feel that it is necessary to follow up with the reporting party, they will do so directly to the reporting party. We will attempt to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of the incident, in that information about the reporter will not be made public, but we cannot guarantee that context of the report will allow the reporter to remain confidential.
