CommunityKit Rules of Conduct

VERSION 0.1

Those who manage and represent CommunityKit pledge to make this service a welcoming, open, and harassment-free environment for all persons, regardless of your identity, background, or the way you express yourself. As a user of CommunityKit, you agree that you will endeavor at all times to help create this welcoming, open, and harassment-free environment.

To help create this environment, we have created a list of rules. All users of CommunityKit must accept and act in accordance with these rules. If you break these rules, your characters, your account, and your privilege to use this service, may be limited or terminated.

Definitions:

"Those who manage and represent CommunityKit" includes the Leadership of CommunityKit, the Community Representatives of CommunityKit, and any System Operators of CommunityKit.

"Users" include all people who access the service.

"Persons" include all persons living or dead, regardless of whether they are users of CommunityKit.

Our Rules:

You acknowledge that you agree to these rules and will abide by them, and that these rules will apply to anyone you allow to use your account, and that you are responsible for any consequences of other people breaking the rules using your account.

You may not harass, threaten, embarrass, or cause distress, unwanted attention, or discomfort to another user.

You may not express unwelcome sexual attention or advances to another user, or use sexually explicit language in public channels.

You may not insult another person, make personal or political attacks, or use derogatory comments to describe that other person.

You may not publish information which would identify a person or their household without that person's explicit consent.

You may not impersonate any representative of CommunityKit.

You may not organize any guilds or groups that are based on, or espouse, any discrimination based on identity, background, or the way a person may express themselves.

You may not give false information or intentionally hide any information that is asked of you at the time you register with CommunityKit.

You will not attempt to interfere with or hack any server or protocol running CommunityKit.

You will not exploit any bug in the CommunityKit product to gain unfair advantage in the game, and you will not communicate the existence of any bugs to any entity other than those who manage or run CommunityKit.

Our Responsibilities:

Those who manage and represent CommunityKit are responsible for taking appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. They also have the right and responsibility to limit content that are not aligned with these Rules of Conduct, and to ban temporarily or permanently any user for violations of these rules or other conduct that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Enforcement:

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by clicking the "Complain" button within the CommunityKit software. Complaints will be reviewed and investigated. If a response is deemed necessary, a response will be made that is appropriate to the circumstances. We will maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of the incident.

Those who manage or represent CommunityKit and who do not follow or enforce these Rules of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the CommunityKit's leadership.
