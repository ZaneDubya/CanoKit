# CommunityKit Governance

This file describes the governance structure of CommunityKit.

## The Players

The players form the heart of CommunityKit. They are a community in a broad sense, although they do not have the ability to redefine the community's morals, values, and ideals; these are set by the Rules of Conduct.

Players must follow the Rules of Conduct. If a player does not follow the Rules of Conduct, they may be de-voiced, or be temporarily or permanently banned from accessing CommunityKit.

Players enforce the rules of conduct by modeling the rules, and by using the Complain feature.

Players have a say in the future of the Community by raising issues to the Community Representatives.
