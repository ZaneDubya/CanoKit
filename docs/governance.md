# CommunityKit Governance

This file describes the governance structure of CommunityKit.

## Players

The players form the heart of CommunityKit. They are a community in a broad sense, although they do not have the ability to redefine the community's morals, values, and ideals; these are set by the Rules of Conduct.
* Players enforce the rules of conduct by modeling the rules, and by using the Complain feature.
* Players have a say in the future of the Community by raising issues to the Counselors and Community Representatives.
* Players must follow the Rules of Conduct. If a player does not follow the Rules of Conduct, they may be de-voiced, or be temporarily or permanently banned from accessing CommunityKit.

## Counselors

The Counslors are experienced player volunteers that assist players with quests and questions about the game. They are tasked with enforcing the Rules of Conduct, and responding to players who attempt to break the Rules of Conduct. Counselors are selected from those players who are knowledgable about the game and who can enforce the Rules of Conduct fairly.
* Counselors receive and respond to Complaints from Players.
* Counselors have administrative powers to help them enforce the Rules of Condut.
  * They may temporarily (up to 1 day) de-voice or ban a player who violates the Rules of Conduct.
  * They may recommend longer sanctions be implemented as well.
* I may decide to add a 'Lead Counselor' role with more administrative powers.
* Counselors must follow the Rules of Conduct in the same way that Players must. If a Counselor does not follow the Rules of Conduct, they may be removed as a Counselor, and may be de-voiced, or be temporarily or permanently banned from accessing CommunityKit.
* Counselors must enforce the Rules of Conduct in good faith. A Counselor who willfully abuses their powers to give advantages to any player or to harass any player will be removed as a Counselor.
* Counselors are selected by the Representatives.

## Representatives

The Representatives are a rotating panel of experienced player volunteers. They are responsible for administration of the game, running the counselor program, and Rules of Conduct enforcement. They also receive and triage requests for new features from the player base.
* Representatives receive and respond to Complaints from Players.
* Representatives have administrative powers to help them enforce the Rules of Conduct.
  * They may temporarily or permanently de-voice or ban a player who violates the Rules of Conduct.
  * They review recommendations for longer punishment times created by Counselors and implement these.
* Representatives run the Counselor program by selecting counselors and removing counselors who violate the spirit of the game. They ensure that Counselors are enforcing the rules of conduct fairly by reviewing Counselor actions.
* Representatives receive requests for new features and changes to the game or community from the Players, and recommend orders of implemntation to the Developers.
* Representatives must follow the Rules of Conduct in the same way that Players must. If a Representative does not follow the Rules of Conduct, they may be removed as a Representative, and may be de-voiced, or be temporarily or permanently banned from accessing CommunityKit.
* Representatives must enforce the Rules of Conduct and run the Counselor program in good faith. A Representative who willfully abuses their powers to give advantages to any player or to harass any player will be removed as a Representative.
* Representatives are selected for a fixed-length term by the Developers. At the end of their term, Representatives revert to being a player once more. Representatives may serve multiple terms as Representative, but may not serve two terms back to back.

## Developers

Developers institute the rules of conduct, create new features for the game, select Representatives, and ensure that the Community Representatives are fairly enforcing the rules of conduct. Develpers must follow the Rules of Conduct, and are ultimately reponsible for making sure that the Rules of Conduct are enforced.
