# How do player SysOps work in CommunityKit?

"SysOps" are player characters that help make sure the game world runs as it should within the boundaries set by the developers of CommunityKit. They are a resource for other players, answering questions about quests and game mechanics. They are enforcers of the rules of conduct, with powers that help them ensure that other players follow the rules.

Most players do not have the ability to play as a SysOp. To gain this ability, a player's account must be flagged by a developer. At the time an account is flagged, the player must select their GM name. This name will never change.

The command to flag a player's account is:

    /makegm name role
    "name" is the player's GM name.
    "role" is an enumerated value, either c, s, or r.

A player who has a sysop flagged account has an additional character slot in the Gallery. That character has no stats or attributes, or race/class/level/alignment/etc. They do have an appearance. In game, their name is always "GM [name]", with an ephitet equal to their sysop role ("Counselor", "Representative", etc.).

There are three kinds of SysOps: Counselors, Senior Counselors, and Representatives. The roles have the same enforcement powers, and only differ in the lengths of time they can apply their powers.

In game, SysOps have access to the Ticket queue and can see player requests for help and complaints.
