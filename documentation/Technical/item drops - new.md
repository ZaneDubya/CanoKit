# Item Picks in MedievaLands

This is a description of the item generation mechanic in MedievaLands. It is a replacement of the vast majority of the item mechanics in Yserbius.

## Item Data Tables

In the original game, there were only 253 item templates. This is now expanded: items are defined by their attributes, which are generated from item data tables. Some of the original item templates from the original game can still be spawned - a few unique items (e.g. Barbarian Axe) and items that are referenced by their template index in map scripts (quest items, lockpicks, a few others).

There are four item data tables:
* medievalands-itemdata - new-tt.csv - the new treasure tables, which determine which items are picked when a monster is killed.
* medievalands-itemdata - new-items.csv - the new base item data, created in large part from Reginald's work on the MedievaLands forums.
* medievalands-itemdata - new-mods.csv - the new modifier data, which describe the new item bonuses, assembled with Reginald's guidance.
* medievalands-itemdata - new-unique.csv - the new unique items, which are picked very rarely and are somewhat more powerful than normal items.

In addition to this new data, each map in Yserbius and Twinion has been appended with the following data:
* One "Map Level" variable, from 1-30. This represents the difficulty of monsters on the map. Higher map levels correspond to better modifier affixes and some better items.
* Two "Treasure Table" references. These are the treasure tables that are used to pick which items will pick. The first table is the "standard" pick table - it is used to pick an item for the first pick in a battle. The second table is the "extra" pick table - it is used to pick subsequent picks in battle.
* Note: If I ever add "unique" encounters to the game (these would be extra-tough monster encounters that a player could find on each map), then I would add an additional "hard" treasure table that would be similar to standard, but would have a better chance of picking more powerful weapons.

All other map variables, including all monster information, are the same, except that the original map treasure table is not used, and the "chance of no pick" is now a constant controlled by the treasure tables, and the original no pick chance value from the monster template is ignored.

## The Treasure Tables and Picks

So how does the game pick which items to pick? The process starts with the treasure tables mentioned above.

A treasure table represents (1) the number of possible picks from a table, (2) the chance a pick will be a "magic quality" pick (with one or two bonus modifiers) or a "unique quality" pick (with three bonus modifiers, one of which is more powerful than any magic item), and (3) a list of either items or sub-tables that the pick will be chosen from, including a chance that no pick will be chosen. Most tables have large chances (60-70%) of no pick, which helps the player not be overwhelmed with items after each combat.

Most of the treasure tables are defined in the "new-tt.csv" file noted above. Some are generated at runtime. These are 10 tables filled with armor types (Armo1 through Armo10) and 10 tables filled with weapon types (Weap1 through Weap10), which are generated at runtime based on the "DropTable" data field in the "new-items.csv" file.

Items are picked during combat as monsters die (or a player uses "Pickpocket" to generate an item drop for that player).
* The first item drop is always picked from Standard (or Unique if this a unique monster encounter), unless one or more items were set by the map script.
* All drops after the first are picked from Extra. The maximum number of drops is five.

## Choosing a Pick

When a pick is needed, the game is passed a treasure table, the player's magic find value, and possibly bonuses to the chance of better quality drops.

The first thing that happens is that the game picks drops from the table.
1. Generate a random number between 0 and (noDrop + sum(pickChances) - 1). Use this random number to pick no drop, or a table or item choice based on this random number.
2. If the pick is no drop, stop and don't add an item.
3. If the pick is a table, start over at step 1 with that table.
4. If the pick is an item, continue with that item.

## Quality Levels

The game now attempts to "upgrade" the pick to a higher quality. There are two For each level of "higher than normal" quality: unique and magic. For each of these higher quality levels, the game will check to see if the picked item will be of that quality (as a side note, I've envisioned including an additional quality level of "Set items", but these are not currently enabled).

After the game has picked an item, the game checks the item's QType value.
* If the QType is 0, the game generates the item and stops the item pick process.
* If the QType is greater than 0, the game proceeds with item generation. If the QType is equal to 2, the game additionally sets an "AlwaysMagic" variable to true. This ensures that the item will, at a minimum, always be of "Magic" quality.

The formula for attempting to select a higher quality level is as follows:

Chance of Quality = (QualityDropBonus * 100) + QualityDropFactor * ((1000 + QualityMF * PlayerMF) รท 1000)
- QualityDropBonus: as treasure table's bonus value. 10 pts = 1% increased drop chance
- QualityDropFactor: 334 for magic, 50 for set, 25 for unique
- QualityMF: 100 for magic, 80 for set, 60 for unique.
- PlayerMF: Player's MF value 

The game generates a random number between 0 and 99999 and checks to see if this value is less than the "Chance of Quality" for each quality level in sequence. A player with no MF will see unique items 0.25% of the time, set items 0.5% of the time, and magic items 3.34% of the time. It takes 10 magic find to double magic item drops, 12.5 pts to double set drops, and 16.5 to double unique drops. As a side note, the chance of a magic item is higher because some items are always magic and because if a unique quality is picked but no unique items can be generated, the item will revert to magic quality.

### Unique Quality

The game attempts to generate unique items first. If the unique quality attempt fails, then the game proceeds to check if a "Magic quality" item drops.

If the unique quality attempt succeeds, the game then checks to see if any unique items can be generated. Unique (and in the future, Set) items are kept in separate tables. The important thing to note is each unique/set item has an item type and a level and a drop ratio. The game picks all unique items matching the item type and with a level less than or equal to the player's level, and chooses a drop based on the ratios of all selected unique items. If no unique items can be generated, then the game sets the AlwaysMagic variable to true, and proceeds with other quality checks.

Unique quality items have preset modifier types. The game selects 

### Magic Quality

If the pick quality check fails, or if there are no unique items available, then the game attempts the next quality level (Magic). For Magic quality items, if the quality attempt succeeds or if the AlwaysMagic variable is true, the game runs an additional check as follows:
* Magic item - prefix only - 38% chance.
* Magic item - suffix only - 38% chance.
* Magic item - both prefix and suffix - 24% chance.

For either/both of prefix and suffix choices, the game assembles a list of all the modifiers that can be chosen from the mod table (based on item type, map level).

### Normal quality

All other items are normal quality with no modifiers.

### Templated items

Some items are templated, and read all stats and template id from the original yserbius data files. They also have the original template item id that is referenced in the original game's map scripts.
